## What's All This, Then

This guide outlines best practices that you will use and when/how to ask for help. The aim is to help you build strong, job-ready practices that you will use in your career as a Software Engineer. Read below for detailed steps!

## Repeat after me

> > "There is nothing wrong with you if you get stuck."

- Everyone in this class will get stuck (even your instructors).
- At Pursuit, we provide you with lots of resources that you can use to get unstuck. The more you practice using resources to get yourself unstuck, the stronger you’ll be as a software engineer.

# First Things To Try

---

### Debug your Code

`console.log` and the debugger are your friends.

Make sure to try running your code with different inputs!

---

### Research The Bug

The answer is not going to appear while you stare at your screen. The answer is not in your heart. This is where research comes in!

- Google the error message ("TypeError: Undefined is not a function").
- Google "MDN" + the concept you don’t understand ("MDN array filter callback").
- Google "JavaScript" + what you are trying to do + what happened instead ("JavaScript forEach loop break statement doesn't work").

---

### If There Is Documentation, Look It Up In The Docs

Documentation sites:

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) (JS, HTML, CSS)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/index.html)

---

### Have I Learned This Before?

Review your notes or past assignments:

- Have you solved a similar problem in a previous lab, project, or quiz?
- Are there relevant code examples in the readmes for the lesson?
- Are there code examples in your class notes?
- Rewatch the class recordings.

---

### Seek External Help

Review other learning resources:

- Codecademy has courses on Intro to Javascript, React, CSS, and more.
- The class READMEs often have links to additional resources.

---

### 🚨 Still Stuck? Ask Your Fellow Fellows! 🚨

- Ask in the #help_code channel on Slack.
- Ask your code question and your peers and volunteers will help!
- Reach out to your squad.
- Pro tip: Ask someone in your squad to be your help buddy.
- Ask in your class channel.

---

### Then Reach Out To Your Instructors

- During class time you can use Slack to message an Instructor or IA.
- Outside of class time, push your code to GitHub and leave a comment in the Canvas assignment. Include the GH link and some specific questions.
- If you are still stuck, there are also office hours!

## How To Ask For Help

### How To Set Your Question Up For Success

Tell people:

- exactly what you’re trying to do
- the code you wrote in order to do that
- what you expected to happen
- what actually happened instead
- what you have already tried to do to solve this on your own (looked up docs, different approaches, etc.)

---

### Include Supplementary Resources

Remember to…

- include the full error message
- paste the code with Slack’s code formatting tool
- not paste screenshots

**If you ask more detailed questions, people can help you right away.**

Unless you LIKE waiting for follow-up questions?

---

### How It's Done

Here's an example of a good request for help:

---

Can someone help me with my code?
I'm trying to print my name to the console.
Here's the code I wrote:

```js
let name = "Mike";
console(name);
```

When I ran the code, I expected to see my name printed in the console.
Instead I got this error message:

```sh
Uncaught TypeError: console is not a function
```

I tried Googling the error message, but the only search results I got were for `console.log`, not the `console` function.

Has anyone else seen this before?

---

# And that's how you ask for help

You're going to need it!

(...because everyone needs it.)
